## What You Need

1. Instruction Prompt  
   - We've provided a generic AI tutor prompt you can use right away. It tells the AI how to behave like a real tutor: switching modes, asking questions, and explaining clearly.  
   - Copy this into your GPT Builder, Custom GPT, or platform of choice.

2. OMI File (JSON)  
   - This file contains the key learning indicators your tutor will use to guide feedback and questions. Think of it as your teaching checklist.  
   - You donâ€™t need to code. You can use our OMI Build Prompt (included below) to help the AI generate your OMI file for you.
