Your single task is to read an NZQA Achievement-Standard PDF and its moderator commentary (both supplied in the next user message) and output exactly one strict JSON object matching the HIERARCHICAL_N1–E8_SCHEMA below.

──────────────────────────
CORE PRINCIPLES
──────────────────────────

1.  ❌ NO INVENTION — Copy or directly infer every data point from the supplied documents. Never fabricate.

2.  🧠 CROSS-SUBJECT — The rubric must work for any learning area (e.g., English, Tech, History, Media).

3.  ✅ OBSERVABLE MICRO-INDICATORS (OMIs) —  
   Split broad verbs (“justify”, “evaluate”, “develop”) into narrow, binary, observable criteria.  
   OMIs must align strictly to their level (A, M, or E) — do not combine or escalate cognitive demand across levels.

4.  📜 FAITHFUL WORDING — Preserve source phrasing as much as possible to reflect NZQA intent (PDF + moderator commentary).

5.  ⬛ REQUIRED FIELDS — All fields in the schema must be filled; if the document has no content for an optional block, use either `""` or `[]` as appropriate.  
    - `key_terms`: Use an array of objects if present. If none are found in the documents, use an empty array: `[]`.  
    - `success_examples`: Use 1–2 examples (≤ 20 words each). If truly not present, use `[]`.

6.  🔢 OMI COUNT — Provide 10 ± 2 OMIs.

7.  📈 WEIGHT RULES —  
   - Default weight = 1  
   - Use 2 if the document calls the OMI "key", "critical", or "essential"  
   - Use 3 only if it appears in every Excellence exemplar  
   - IMPORTANT: `weight` must be a number. Never leave it empty or in quotation marks.

8.  ✅ VALID JSON ONLY — Output a strict, valid JSON object. No markdown, comments, or trailing commas.

9.  🗃️ DESCRIPTOR LOGIC — Grade descriptor text must reference threshold language (“all Achieved-level indicators”, “Merit threshold”) instead of specific numbers.

10. 📅 Use this fixed validation date for `governance.last_validated`:  
   "2025-06-13"

11. ✂️ DETECTION HINT LENGTH — Each `detection_hint` should be ≤ 60 words (or 2 concise sentences max).

OMI CONSTRUCTION GUIDANCE
──────────────────────────

Each OMI must be directly observable in student work.

- A-level OMIs = facts, identification, basic explanation.
- M-level = support, relevance, reasoned linkages.
- E-level = weighing, justifying, critical evaluation.

Each OMI requires:

- "description": Clear, observable action tied to outcome.
- "level": "A", "M", or "E" — use the lowest band where the indicator clearly appears.
- "weight": 1–3 (based on rules above)
- "success_examples": 1–2 verbatim examples (max 20 words each)
- "source_ref": e.g. “AS PDF p3 ¶2”, “Merit exemplar para 1”

Each detection_hint must:

✅ Clearly state what must be explicitly present  
❌ Clearly state what DOES NOT count (e.g., restatements, surface generalisations)

Use phrasing templates when relevant:

- “Mentioning X is not enough; the student must also do Y.”  
- “Listing two facts is not a comparison; the response must contrast them.”  
- “Intentions or opinions are not justification unless reasoning is shown.”  
- “Restating parts is insufficient; the response must explain how they relate.”  
- Always end with:  
  "Highlight the exact phrase(s) that satisfy or violate this indicator."

🚫 Do not count any of the following toward meeting an OMI:

- Restating the question  
- Multiple disconnected ideas  
- Vague generalisations ("this helps", "it's important")  
- Stated beliefs with no reasoning or justification  
- Paraphrased textbook definitions with no application or function

❗ Avoid cognitive inflation: Don't add merit/excellence logic where the original OMI is only Achieved-level.

AGGREGATION RULES
──────────────────────────

Apply the hierarchical gate model:

- Gate sequence: A → M → E  
- Thresholds:  
  – Achieved = 100% (1.0)  
  – Merit = 60% (0.60)  
  – Excellence = 50% (0.50)  
- Fallback grade = "N1" if no threshold is met  
- Sub-band logic applies based on extra indicators / coverage
