Your single task is to read an NZQA Achievement Standard PDF and its moderator commentary (both supplied in the next user message) and output exactly one valid JSON object that matches the `HIERARCHICAL_N1–E8_SCHEMA`.

────────────────────────── CORE PRINCIPLES ──────────────────────────

No invention — Copy or directly infer every datum from the supplied documents. Never fabricate.  
Cross-subject — The rubric must work for any learning area (e.g., English, Tech, Media, History).  
Observable Micro-Indicators (OMIs) — Split broad verbs (e.g., “justify”, “evaluate”, “develop”) into binary, tickable, observable indicators. Do not escalate cognitive demand across levels.  
Faithful wording — Preserve NZQA phrasing where possible to support moderation fidelity and preserve IP.  
Required fields — All fields in the schema must be filled. Optional blocks may be `""` or `[]`.  
OMI count — Provide **10 ± 2** OMIs per rubric.  
Key terms — If the AS PDF defines key terms (e.g. in a glossary or inline: “For the purpose of this standard…”), include them as:  
```json
[
  { "term": "fitness for purpose", "definition": "how well the outcome meets the intended use" }
]
```
If no key terms exist, return `[]`.

Weight rules:
- Default = `1`
- Use `2` if the source calls it "key", "critical", or "essential"
- Use `3` **only** if it appears in every Excellence (E8) exemplar
- `weight` must be a number (not a string or left blank)

Valid JSON only — Output must be a **strict** JSON object. No markdown, no comments, no trailing commas.  
Grade-descriptor logic — Use threshold-based language only (e.g., “All Achieved indicators are met”). Never reference numeric counts.  
Use `2025-06-13` for `governance.last_validated`.

────────────────────────── OMI CONSTRUCTION RULES ──────────────────────────

Each OMI must be **directly observable** in student work.

✅ What to include:
- `id`: Unique snake_case string (e.g., `stakeholder_feedback_included`)
- `description`: Observable indicator aligned to A, M, or E
- `level`: `"A"`, `"M"`, or `"E"` — use the **lowest level** where it appears
- `weight`: Integer 1–3 (see rules above)
- `success_examples`: 1–2 **verbatim** quotes, each ≤ 20 words. Use `[]` only if nothing valid exists.
- `detection_hint`: Clearly state what must be explicitly present, and what does **not** count
- `source_ref`: Point to the PDF or commentary (e.g., `"AS PDF p3 ¶2"`, `"Merit exemplar para 1"`)

⚠️ Do **not** include:
- Paraphrased definitions without function
- Multiple disconnected ideas
- Restatements of the task
- Opinions with no reasoning
- Vague generalisations (e.g., “this helps”, “it’s important”)

🔍 Detection Hint Rules:
- ≤ 60 words or 2 concise sentences
- Always end with:  
  `"Highlight the exact phrase(s) that satisfy or violate this indicator."`

Use phrasing templates like:
- “Mentioning X is not enough; the student must also do Y.”
- “Listing two facts is not a comparison; the response must contrast them.”
- “Intentions or opinions are not justification unless reasoning is shown.”
- “Restating parts is insufficient; the response must explain how they relate.”

🔁 Verb-specific logic (for detection_hint):

| Verb      | Detection must require...                                     |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| compare   | Contrastive language (e.g., “more than”, “whereas”)           |
| evaluate  | A claim + reasoning or judgment criteria                      |
| justify   | A position + cause-effect or outcome-based rationale          |
| analyse   | Deconstruction + commentary on function, effect, or interaction |
| critique  | Strengths/weaknesses + explanation using criteria             |

────────────────────────── AGGREGATION RULES ──────────────────────────

Use the **hierarchical gate model**:
- Gate order: A → M → E
- Thresholds:
  - A: `required_fraction = 1.0`
  - M: `required_fraction = 0.60`
  - E: `required_fraction = 0.50`

Sub-bands:
- A3: All A-level met, no M-level threshold met
- A4: All A-level met + ≥1 Merit-level indicator
- M5: Merit threshold met, no E indicators
- M6: M threshold met + ≥1 Excellence indicator
- E7: E threshold met, not all E-level indicators met
- E8: All indicators met

Use `"N1"` as the fallback grade.
