# Modos

**Modos** is a framework for designing AI tutors that think and teach like real educators — shifting between strategies, circling back to concepts, and responding to students in real time.

At its core, Modos is built on a simple idea:  
*Learning is messy, non-linear, and effortful.*  
Students often need to explore, struggle, revise, and reframe before something truly clicks. Great teachers shift their approach to support that. **Modos brings this adaptive mindset to AI.**

Modos is not a chatbot or plug-and-play tutor — it's a toolkit to help you build *your own* AI tutors that do two things well:

## 🎓 The Two Paths

Modos provides two core tutor frameworks:

### 🔹 `/understand/`  
For **building conceptual understanding** — helping students describe, explain, and analyse ideas.  
These tutors guide learning by questioning, checking for misconceptions, and offering structured explanations.

> Think: science concepts, essay topic understanding, history themes, math ideas.

### 🔹 `/process/`  
For **constructing student work** — guiding the process of writing an essay, building a brief, or planning a response.  
These tutors focus on structure, idea development, and clarity — helping students shape their thinking as they work.

> Think: design briefs, English essays, project plans, technology portfolios.

## 🔧 How It Works

Modos tutors are built using:
- **OMIs (Observable Micro-Indicators):** Small, checkable indicators of learning or task completion.
- **Content files:** Examples, definitions, and scaffolds that ground the AI’s feedback.
- **Instruction prompts:** Define the AI’s teaching role, its modes (e.g. quiz, explain, diagnose), and how it shifts strategies in response to student needs.

## 🧭 Getting Started

If you’re new to Modos, check out the [`getting-started/`](./getting-started) folder for a walkthrough on:
- How to define OMIs
- How to structure prompts
- How to deploy tutors using your preferred LLM platform (e.g. GPT Builder, OpenRouter)

Modos is model-agnostic and works with any system that supports prompt-based AI behavior.

## ✍️ Why Use Modos?

Because students don’t all need the same explanation — and they don’t all get it the first time.

Modos tutors adapt. They shift modes. They explain differently.  
They pause, redirect, or ask questions — just like good teachers do.
