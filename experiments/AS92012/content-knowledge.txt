## AS92012 (1.1) Content Knowledge File  
### Purpose  
Students **develop, refine, and evaluate** a Materials & Processing Technology outcome for a real user or community within an authentic context.  
(See AS purpose & explanatory notes for full detail.) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

### Pick‑a‑Context Menu  
Teachers choose **one** context below (or adapt a new one) to suit materials, interests, and facilities. Each context can be explored through **any technological area** (wood, metal, fabrics, food, plastics, multimaterials, laser‑cutting, 3‑D printing, etc.).

| Icon | Context | Core idea | Example outcomes |
|------|---------|-----------|------------------|
| 🍞 | **Manaakitanga – Food for Others** | Show care/hospitality by making food for a specific person or group. (Manaakitanga = respect & kindness.) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} | Pies, spring rolls, baking gifts, hamper items |
| 🧺 | **Solve a Storage Problem** | Design storage that tidies, protects, or displays items for someone’s space. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} | Shelf, shoe rack, drawer insert, “Don’t Sweat the Small Stuff” box |
| 🧍 | **Tuakiri – Identity Expression** | Create something that reflects a person’s culture, interests, or story. | Printed tote, carved heru, decorated jewellery stand, laser‑cut plaque |
| 💡 | **Everyday Problem Solver** | Make a practical item that simplifies daily life at home, school, or work. | Phone stand, cable organiser, light fixture, drink‑bottle holder |
| 🧸 | **Sensory or Learning Tool** | Produce a tool that helps someone focus, relax, or learn. | Fidget board, multi‑sensory mat, calming box, soft game aid |
| 👕 | **Clothing or Accessories** | Design wearable or soft‑goods that meet a user’s needs or identity. | Hoodie, apron, school bag, kapa haka sash |
| 🧴 | **Personal Care or Support** | Create an item that supports wellbeing or daily routines. | Toiletry bag, organiser pouch, mirror stand, personal caddy |

### Key Concepts & Definitions  
| Term | Plain meaning |
|------|---------------|
| **Brief** | Statement of purpose, end‑user, and intended environment. |
| **Specifications** | *Short, precise, measurable* requirements (physical + functional). |
| **Stakeholder feedback** | Written/verbal input from **≥ 2 people** at **≥ 2 stages** guiding development. |
| **Fitness for purpose** | How well the final outcome meets the brief & specs in its real environment. |

---

### Example Specification Bank  
*(Select up to five that suit your chosen context.)*

| # | Physical | Functional |
|---|----------|------------|
| 1 | Footprint ≤ 350 × 250 mm | Moving parts operate with ≤ 5 N force |
| 2 | Mass ≤ 2 kg (empty) | Protects contents from dust / moisture ingress |
| 3 | Food‑safe or hypoallergenic materials where required | Cleanable in < 2 min using normal routine |
| 4 | ≥ 70 % recycled or locally sourced material | Stackable / nestable without damaging finish |
| 5 | Surface finish free of splinters, burrs, frays | Maintains integrity after 10 drops from 500 mm |

### Suggested Learning Pathway  
1. **Investigate** – Explore need, draft brief, identify user pain‑points.  
2. **Ideate** – Generate and rank several concepts.  
3. **Model & Trial** – Build quick prototype; test fit/capacity.  
4. **Gather Feedback** – Consult stakeholders at prototype stages.  
5. **Refine** – Modify dimensions, materials; record reasons.  
6. **Make** – Fabricate final outcome; capture process evidence.  
7. **Evaluate** – Test in real environment; measure against specs.  
8. **Analyse** – Discuss trade‑offs, future improvements.

---

### Reflection Prompts for Learners  
1. Which **specification** will be hardest to measure and why?  
2. How did **stakeholder feedback** change your design priorities?  
3. Where might the outcome fail its **fitness‑for‑purpose** test, and how can you pre‑empt that?
