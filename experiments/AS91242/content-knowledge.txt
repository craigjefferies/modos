## 1 | Why “Development” Differs
- **Definition** – Development combines economic welfare *and* social wellbeing (health & education):contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- **Key driver**: Unequal access to resources, opportunities and power → spatial patterns of advantage / disadvantage.  
- **Framework to explain**  
  1. **Characteristics** (What varies?)  
  2. **Measurement** (How big is the gap?)  
  3. **Factors / Processes** (Why does it exist?)  
  4. **Responses** (How could it be reduced?)

## 2 | Indicators Cheat-Sheet
| Type | Examples | Strength | Limitation |
|------|----------|----------|------------|
| **Single (Quant.)** | GDP pc, Life-expectancy, Literacy, Infant-mortality | Clear, comparable numbers | Oversimplify; hide inequality:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} |
| **Composite** | **HDI** (Life-expectancy + Education + Income) | Adds social dimensions | Still averages at national scale:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} |
| | **Child Opportunity Index** (29 vars: health, education, environment, economy) | Captures neighbourhood opportunity | Data-heavy, US-specific:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} |

> Mixed-methods rule: pair numbers with local stories for true insight:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

## 3 | Case Study – Chicago, USA  
A city-scale lens makes internal disparities concrete.

### 3.1 Key Spatial Data  
| Indicator | Pattern & Insight |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Life expectancy** | Highest in North-side lakefront suburbs; lowest in South & West sides:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5} |
| **Median household income** | Mirrors life-expectancy pattern: wealthy North vs low-income South/West:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6} |
| **Child Opportunity Index** | Very-High in northern suburbs, Very-Low in South-side tracts – multidimensional gap:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7} |
| **Community HDI** | Lincoln Park ≈ Switzerland; Washington Park ≈ some developing nations – extreme internal contrast:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8} |

### 3.2 Historical Process – Redlining
- 1930s HOLC maps graded neighbourhoods; “red” areas denied loans:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- Long-term consequences:  
  - **Wealth** – home-equity gap drives racial wealth inequality:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
  - **Education** – school funding tied to property taxes → under-resourced schools in redlined zones:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
  - **Health & Environment** – toxic exposure, food deserts raise chronic illness risk:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
  - **Policing** – spatial profiling reinforces aggressive policing patterns:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  

> **Exam tip**: Link historical process (redlining) to today’s spatial indicators to show *causation not correlation*.

## 4 | Explaining the Gap (PEEL template)
1. **Point** – Identify a clear pattern (e.g., South Chicago has Very-Low HDI).  
2. **Evidence** – Quote indicator value / map observation.  
3. **Explanation** – Connect to causal factors (redlining → disinvestment → low income).  
4. **Link** – Compare to contrasting area (e.g., Lincoln Park) + suggest strategy.

## 5 | Strategies & Evaluation
| Strategy | Expected Impact | Critical Check |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Targeted health & education funding | Lifts HDI components quickly | Must address systemic housing policy or gains fade |
| Fair-housing & anti-redlining enforcement | Opens access to asset building | Slow culture & market change |
| Composite-index tracking (e.g., COI dashboard) | Monitors multidimensional progress | Data gaps risk blind spots |

## 6 | Common Student Pitfalls
1. Relying on **one number** (GDP or income) – always triangulate with social indicators.  
2. Describing patterns without **naming places** (e.g., “north-side” vs “Lincoln Park”).  
3. Mixing **indicator** (what) with **factor** (why).  
4. Ignoring **scale** – neighbourhood vs national comparisons.  
5. Forgetting historical processes (e.g., redlining) that created today’s pattern.
