## **Merit Level – Linking Technical → Human Impact**

### 5) Complaint Clinic – Vision Edition
**Targets:** Explains how problems relate to human needs.  
**Activity:**  
- Given three user complaints about a vision system (e.g., AR headset lag).  
- For each: name the mechanism involved, explain the cause, and describe the human impact.  

**Prompt:**  
"Make a text-based worksheet with 3 user complaints about a vision system. Students identify the mechanism, explain the cause, and describe the human impact."  
**Student Prompt:**  
"Give me three user complaints about a vision system. Then ask me to name the mechanism, explain the cause, and describe the human impact, one complaint at a time."

### 6) Capability Swap
**Targets:** Compares perspectives.  
**Activity:**  
- Read two methods for depth detection (LiDAR vs stereo vision).  
- Compare cost, accuracy, and application.  
- State which is better for a given scenario and why.  

**Prompt:**  
"Write a text-only activity where students compare two computer vision methods and justify which is better in a scenario."  
**Student Prompt:**  
"Give me two methods for the same vision task. Then ask me to compare them and choose one with reasons, one factor at a time."

---

### 7) Before/After Reasoning – Image Fix
**Targets:** Explains how problems are addressed; Links to human needs.  
**Activity:**  
- Compare two versions of a processed image (noisy vs denoised).  
- Identify two changes, explain the algorithm applied, and the impact on analysis accuracy.  

**Prompt:**  
"Create a text-based activity comparing two image versions, identifying changes, algorithms, and impacts."  
**Student Prompt:**  
"Give me two image descriptions. Then ask me to identify changes, link to an algorithm, and explain the impact, one change at a time."

---

## **Excellence Level – Comparative Judgment & Future Thinking**

### 8) Which Mechanism Wins — and Why?
**Targets:** Compares use of mechanisms; Judges effectiveness.  
**Activity:**  
- Read two approaches to traffic sign recognition (traditional feature detection vs CNN).  
- Compare accuracy, speed, and scalability.  
- Decide which is better and justify with reasoning.  

**Prompt:**  
"Make a text-based worksheet comparing two approaches to the same vision task, contrasting mechanisms and deciding which is better."  
**Student Prompt:**  
"Give me two approaches to a vision task. Then ask me to compare them, choose one, and justify, one factor at a time."

---

### 9) Redesign with Limits – Vision Upgrade
**Targets:** Suggests multiple improvements; Judges effectiveness.  
**Activity:**  
- Read a flawed CV system description (e.g., false positives in security).  
- Suggest three improvements linked to algorithms/mechanisms.  
- Explain benefits and rank by priority.  

**Prompt:**  
"Write a text-only activity where students suggest improvements to a flawed vision system, explain benefits, and rank them."
