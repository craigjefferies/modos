• human biological evolution
• human cultural evolution
• patterns of dispersal of hominins

Biological evolution includes:
• skeletal changes linked to bipedalism (pelvis, spine, valgus angle)
• skull and endocranial changes
• hand manipulative ability evolution

Cultural evolution includes:
• use of tools (stone, wood, bone)
• use of fire
• clothing
• abstract thought: communication, language, art
