# Content Knowledge – AS92005 (Develop a Digital Technologies Outcome)

This file provides scaffolding knowledge for students developing **any type of outcome** (electronics, animation, web, software, media, etc.).  
It is structured around the **core assessment ideas**: purpose, users, requirements, specifications, conventions, testing, trialling, refinement, optimal tool use, and fitness for purpose.  

Potential Outcomes include:
- Web / Web Application: Projects that build websites or web apps to deliver information, interaction, or services to users through a browser.
- Graphics / 3D / Animation: Projects focused on creating visual assets, animations, or 3D models for presentation or embedding.
- Interactive Multimedia / Storytelling: Projects combining text, visuals, interactivity, and narrative elements to engage users in stories or information exploration.
- Embedded / Physical / Electronics: Projects that interface with hardware (sensors, LEDs, microcontrollers) to sense, display, or react in the physical world.
- App / Data / Utilities: Projects that manage, present, or process data in a usable application (e.g. to-do lists, logging, quizzes) for end users.

## 1. Purpose
- The **purpose** is the reason the outcome exists.  
- A clear purpose answers: *What is this for? Who benefits?*  
- Example phrases:  
  - “The purpose of my website is to help students plan revision timetables.”  
  - “This LED circuit is for a safety indicator in a bike light.”  

---

## 2. Users
- **Potential users** are the people who will interact with or rely on the outcome.  
- Be specific (e.g., “Year 10 students using a learning app”) rather than broad (“everyone”).  
- Identifying users ensures the outcome is relevant and testable.  

---

## 3. Requirements and Specifications
- **Requirements**: broad needs or conditions the outcome must meet.  
- **Specifications**: measurable details that prove the requirements are satisfied.  

Examples:  
- Requirement: “The circuit must run on a 3.3V microprocessor pin.”  
- Specification: “LED series resistor value chosen so current is ≤ 15 mA.”  
- Requirement: “The animation must explain a science concept clearly.”  
- Specification: “Run time ≤ 90 seconds, with narration synced to text.”  

---

## 4. Conventions
- **Conventions** are standard practices in each domain.  
- Examples:  
  - Web: meaningful file names, indentation, semantic HTML tags.  
  - Software: consistent variable naming, comments, modular structure.  
  - Animation: use of layers, keyframes, and naming conventions.  
  - Electronics: circuit diagrams use correct symbols, LED always has a series resistor, voltage dividers calculated for sensor inputs.  

---

## 5. Testing
- **Testing** = the student examines their own outcome.  
- Purpose: ensure the **basic functionality works**.  

Examples:  
- Electronics: measure LED current with different resistor values; check a voltage divider matches sensor input range.  
- Software: run the program with sample inputs; confirm correct outputs.  
- Web: test layout on different browsers/devices.  
- Animation: play sequence to check smooth timing and correct transitions.  

---

## 6. Trialling
- **Trialling** = letting others (ideally end users) use the outcome.  
- Purpose: gather **real feedback** to guide improvements.  

Examples:  
- Electronics: ask classmates to connect the circuit and observe usability.  
- Software: let target users run the program and note confusion points.  
- Animation: share draft video with peers; ask if message was clear.  
- Web: invite testers to use navigation menu; record where they get stuck.  

---

## 7. Refinement and Improvements
- **Refinement** = making changes based on evidence from testing/trialling.  
- Always **link the change to the evidence**.  

Examples:  
- Electronics: trial shows LED is too dim → change resistor to lower value (within safe limits).  
- Software: user feedback shows confusing menu → simplify navigation order.  
- Animation: timing too fast for readability → increase frame duration.  
- Web: testing reveals slow load times → compress images.  

---

## 8. Optimal Use of Tools/Techniques
- **Optimal** = best practicable use for the task, *informed by testing and trialling*.  
- Not about complexity or AI automation — about making **evidence-based choices**.  

Examples:  
- **Electronics**:  
  - Calculating a series resistor so an LED operates safely on a microprocessor pin.  
  - Designing a voltage divider that correctly scales sensor output to ADC input range.  
  - Using pull-up/pull-down resistors on microprocessor inputs for stable signals.  
- **Software**:  
  - Choosing data structures that make a program efficient *after testing with sample data*.  
  - Refactoring variable names so users/teachers can understand the program’s purpose.  
- **Web**:  
  - Adjusting font sizes or contrast after trialling shows readability issues.  
- **Animation**:  
  - Tweaking colour palettes and timing based on viewer comprehension feedback.  

**Key Idea:**  
> Optimal use comes from linking **tool/technique choices** to **fitness for purpose**, based on **evidence** gathered in testing and trialling.

## 9. Fitness for Purpose
An outcome is **fit for purpose** when:  
- It meets all requirements and specifications.  
- It functions reliably in its intended context.  
- It satisfies user needs (shown through trialling).  

Examples:  
- Electronics: microprocessor circuit operates safely and reliably with correct voltage/current levels.  
- Software: program runs without errors and produces correct outputs.  
- Animation: communicates intended message clearly to viewers.  
- Web: site loads across devices and is usable by its target audience.
