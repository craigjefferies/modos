# 3. Core Mechanisms (Techniques, Algorithms, Protocols, Processes)

> These explain **how encryption works** at a conceptual level.  
> Each mechanism contains **Describe (A)**, **Explain (M)**, **Discuss (E)**.

## 3.1 Symmetric Encryption (AES)

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Achieved – Describe** | One key is used to encrypt and decrypt data. |
| **Merit – Explain** | AES mixes and shuffles data in repeated steps. Even tiny changes to the key produce completely different encrypted output. |
| **Excellence – Discuss** | Symmetric keys must be shared securely. If a student leaks the Wi-Fi key (WPA2-Personal), the whole school network becomes vulnerable. |

**School Example:**  
AES is used in **school Wi-Fi (WPA2/WPA3)** to encrypt student internet traffic so outsiders cannot spy on it.

---

## 3.2 Asymmetric Encryption (RSA / ECC)

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Achieved** | Uses a **public key** to encrypt and a **private key** to decrypt. |
| **Merit** | Solves the “key sharing problem” because only the private key holder can decrypt. |
| **Excellence** | If private keys are stolen (e.g., from a poorly secured staff laptop), digital signatures and secure communication for the whole school can be compromised. |

**School Example:**  
Used when students log into cloud services (Google/Microsoft). The connection is secured using asymmetric key exchange.

---

## 3.3 Hashing (SHA-256)

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Achieved** | One-way encryption. Cannot be reversed. |
| **Merit** | Small changes to input produce completely different hash values — good for checking integrity. |
| **Excellence** | Schools must store hashed (not plain) passwords. Poor hashing (e.g., MD5) risks mass student account breaches. |

**School Example:**  
School portal passwords are stored as hashes so admins cannot see them.

---

## 3.4 Key Exchange (Diffie–Hellman)

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Achieved** | A process to create a shared secret key over the internet. |
| **Merit** | Even if someone listens to the exchange, they cannot calculate the shared key. |
| **Excellence** | If older versions are used (without authentication), attackers can perform a man-in-the-middle attack and trick devices into creating keys with them. |

**School Example:**  
WPA3-Personal uses “Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE),” an improved key-exchange method.

---

## 3.5 Wi-Fi Encryption Protocols (WPA2/WPA3 – Personal vs Enterprise)

| Protocol | Mechanism | Strength | School Impact |
|----------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| **WPA2-Personal** | One shared password for all students. | Medium | If students share the password, the whole network is exposed. |
| **WPA3-Personal** | Uses SAE for stronger shared key generation. | Strong | More resistant to password-guessing attacks. |
| **WPA2-Enterprise** | Each user has their own login (username + password). | Strong | If one student shares their password, only their account is affected. |
| **WPA3-Enterprise** | Strongest Wi-Fi security; individual encrypted sessions. | Very Strong | Schools gain per-student accountability + highest protection. |

**School Note:**  
NZQA expects analysis of **WPA2/WPA3 in school use**.

---

## 3.6 VPN Encryption Processes

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Achieved** | A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel between a device and the school network. |
| **Merit** | Encrypts all data passing through, preventing spying from home Wi-Fi or public hotspots. |
| **Excellence** | If VPN settings are misconfigured, DNS leaks may expose student browsing even though the tunnel is encrypted. |

**School Example:**  
Teachers use a VPN to access the SMS (e.g., KAMAR/Edge) securely from home.

---

## 3.7 Device Encryption (BitLocker + TPM)

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Achieved** | BitLocker encrypts the data on a laptop’s storage. |
| **Merit** | The key is stored in a secure hardware chip (TPM), preventing easy extraction. |
| **Excellence** | Lost unencrypted devices put sensitive student data at risk; encrypted devices reduce breach severity and legal issues. |

**School Example:**  
Teacher laptops with IEPs, pastoral notes, and attendance data must be encrypted.

---

## 3.8 Password Manager Encryption Workflow

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Achieved** | Stores passwords in an encrypted vault locked by one master password. |
| **Merit** | The vault is decrypted only on the user’s device. Even the password manager provider cannot see the contents. |
| **Excellence** | Human factors matter: weak master passwords undermine the entire system. Training is essential in school contexts. |

**School Example:**  
Students managing multiple logins (Wi-Fi, Google, LMS) use a password manager to reduce weak password reuse.

---

## 3.9 Digital Signatures (Authentication + Integrity)

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Achieved** | Uses a hash + private key to prove who created a document. |
| **Merit** | If the document changes, the signature becomes invalid — ensures integrity. |
| **Excellence** | If a school’s signing key is stolen, fake school reports or permission slips could be produced. Key security is critical. |

**School Example:**  
Digitally signed PDF school reports ensure they are authentic and untampered.

---

# 4. Evaluation Concepts (Encryption Strength & Security)

| Concept | Explanation | School Relevance |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Key Length** | Longer keys take longer to brute-force. | WPA3 uses stronger key lengths than WPA2. |
| **Encryption Strength** | How resistant the algorithm is to attacks. | Schools must avoid outdated algorithms (e.g., WEP, MD5). |
| **Collision Resistance** | Hash functions avoid two inputs giving same output. | Essential for password security and digital signatures. |
| **Computational Cost** | Encryption intensity affects device performance. | Older student laptops may struggle with WPA3. |
| **Entropy** | Randomness in passwords/keys. | Students using “12345” lowers security regardless of algorithm. |
| **Attack Models** | Understanding threats like brute force, MITM. | Helps justify why the school uses VPNs or enterprise Wi-Fi. |

# 5. Impacts (Ethical, Social, Human Factors, Sustainability, Future-Proofing)

## 5.1 Ethical Issues
- Encryption protects **student privacy and safety online**.  
- Lack of encryption may expose browsing history, chats, or personal data.  
- Raises questions about **monitoring vs privacy**: how much should schools inspect?  

## 5.2 Social Impact
- Encrypted communication platforms reduce cyberbullying evidence tampering.  
- Secure Wi-Fi access enables equitable learning online.  
- Weak encryption disproportionately affects vulnerable students.

## 5.3 Human Factors
- Students reuse simple passwords → encryption fails due to human error.  
- Teachers may forget BitLocker recovery keys.  
- Students using personal hotspots bypass school filtering → risk exposure.

## 5.4 Sustainability
- Stronger algorithms require more processing power.  
- Older devices may not support WPA3, creating a budget impact.  

## 5.5 Future Proofing
- Schools must plan for **algorithm upgrades** (WPA2 → WPA3).  
- Quantum computing may weaken today’s algorithms → long-term planning needed.  
- Password managers future-proof password security habits.

# 6. Common Misconceptions (School-Focused)

| Misconception | Correction |
|---------------|------------|
| “Encryption = strong passwords.” | Encryption is separate. Weak passwords still break strong systems. |
| “Hashing is reversible.” | True encryption can be reversed; hashing cannot. |
| “WPA2-Personal is secure if we change the password often.” | The shared password is the weakness. Students sharing it compromises everyone. |
| “VPN makes you anonymous.” | VPN encrypts traffic, but the provider still sees your connection. |
| “BitLocker protects cloud files.” | BitLocker encrypts the **device**, not cloud storage. |
| “Public key means anyone can read messages.” | Public key encrypts; only the private key decrypts. |
| “Password managers are unsafe because everything is in one place.” | The vault is encrypted—only the master password unlocks it. |
