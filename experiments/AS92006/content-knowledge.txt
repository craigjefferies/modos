## Usability Concepts  
Usability is about making sure something is **easy, clear, and pleasant to use**.  

Key ideas include:  

-  **Correct te reo Māori** – Interfaces use proper spelling and macrons across UI, inputs, and stored text. For example, show **Māori**, **kōrero**, and **whānau** correctly in menus and search.  
- **Internal consistency** – Within the same app or site, similar things should look and act the same. For example, if “Save” is always a green button, it should look and be in the same place on every page.  
- **External consistency** – The app or site should work in a way that feels familiar compared to other apps. For example, using the same trash-bin icon for deleting files, because most users already know that symbol.  
- **Accessibility** – Designing so everyone can use it, including people with disabilities (e.g., screen-reader compatibility, captions for videos, high-contrast text for low-vision users).  
- **Nielsen’s usability heuristics** – Ten general rules of thumb for designing better, easier-to-use interfaces.

### Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics (with more detail)  

1. **Visibility of system status** – Always keep users updated on what’s happening. For example, when uploading a photo, show a progress bar so they know it’s still working.  

2. **Match with the real world** – Use words, images, and ideas that match the user’s everyday life. Avoid confusing tech terms if there’s a simpler way to say it. For example, say “Shopping cart” instead of “Purchase container.”  

3. **User control and freedom** – Let users fix mistakes or back out easily. Have an “Undo” button or a clear way to exit without losing work.  

4. **Consistency and standards** – Stick to the same wording, layout, and icons so users don’t have to guess what something means. Also follow common standards across apps so it feels familiar.  

5. **Error prevention** – Design so mistakes are less likely to happen. For example, grey out the “Submit” button until all required fields are filled in.  

6. **Recognition rather than recall** – Don’t make users remember hidden info. Show them options instead of expecting them to recall commands. Example: A drop-down list of countries instead of asking users to type the country code.  

7. **Flexibility and efficiency of use** – Let beginners take the easy route, but give advanced users shortcuts. For example, keyboard shortcuts for experts while keeping menus for new users.  

8. **Aesthetic and minimalist design** – Keep things clean and uncluttered. Only show information that’s needed right now so the user doesn’t get overwhelmed.  

9. **Help users recover from errors** – If something goes wrong, give a clear, friendly message explaining the problem and how to fix it. Avoid scary codes like “Error 404” without explanation.  

10. **Help and documentation** – Sometimes people need instructions. Make help easy to find, simple to read, and focused on what they need to do.
