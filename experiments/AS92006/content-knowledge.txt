### Mātāpono Māori Principles
[cite_start]Mātāpono Māori principles related to usability include the accurate use of te reo Māori, support for te reo Māori in tools like spell-checking, and support for the expression of tikanga and mātauranga Māori[cite: 49, 50, 51, 52].

### Usability Concepts
[cite_start]Usability concepts include internal and external consistency, accessibility, and Nielsen's usability heuristics[cite: 54, 55, 56].

#### Consistency
* **Internal Consistency**: This refers to the design being consistent within a single interface or application. For example, all buttons of a certain type should look and behave the same way.
* **External Consistency**: This refers to a design being consistent with other applications or the operating system. For example, using standard icons and menus that users are already familiar with from other software.

#### Nielsen's Usability Heuristics
[cite_start]Nielsen's heuristics are a set of ten general principles for user interface design[cite: 56]. They are called "heuristics" because they are broad rules of thumb, not specific usability guidelines. These principles can be applied to evaluate and improve the usability of an interface.

1.  **Visibility of system status**: The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable time.
2.  **Match between system and the real world**: The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. It should follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.
3.  **User control and freedom**: Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.
4.  **Consistency and standards**: Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions. [cite_start]This relates to both internal and external consistency[cite: 54].
5.  **Error prevention**: Even better than good error messages is a careful design that prevents a problem from occurring in the first place.
6.  **Recognition rather than recall**: Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another.
7.  **Flexibility and efficiency of use**: Accelerators—unseen by the novice user—may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users.
8.  **Aesthetic and minimalist design**: Dialogues should not contain information that is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.
9.  **Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**: Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.
10. **Help and documentation**: Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. This information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.
