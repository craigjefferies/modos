## Achieved Level – Creative Starters

### 1) Purpose Postcard
**Targets:** Describes the purpose of human-computer interfaces; Identifies and describes usability principles used in an interface  
**Activity:**
- Read a short written description of a school library app home screen.  
- Write the purpose in 2–3 sentences.  
- List three usability principles and briefly describe how each appears.  

**Prompt:**  
"Create a text-based individual worksheet where students read an interface description, state its purpose, and describe three usability principles shown."

---

### 2) Feature-to-Principle Snap
**Targets:** Identifies and describes usability principles used in an interface  
**Activity:**
- Given six interface features in text, match each to a usability principle.  
- Write one sentence showing how the feature applies that principle.  

**Prompt:**  
"Make a text-only worksheet where students match interface features to usability principles and justify each match in one sentence."

---

### 3) What’s This Screen For?
**Targets:** Describes the purpose of human-computer interfaces  
**Activity:**
- Read a paragraph about a bus ticket purchase screen.  
- Write a precise purpose statement.  
- Underline the exact words in the text that support your statement.  

**Prompt:**  
"Write a text-based activity where students read a description of an interface, state its purpose, and highlight supporting details."

---

### 4) Spot & Say
**Targets:** Identifies and describes usability principles used in an interface  
**Activity:**
- Read a text walkthrough of a sign-up flow.  
- Identify three places a usability principle appears.  
- Complete the stem for each: “This shows [principle] because [specific behaviour/element].”  

**Prompt:**  
"Create a written worksheet where students read an interface walkthrough, spot usability principles, and explain each with a sentence stem."

## Merit Level – Linking Principle → Feature → User Outcome

### 5) Complaint Clinic
**Targets:** Explains how usability principles have been applied in the interface; Explains how the interface’s usability aids the user experience  
**Activity:**
- Given three short user complaints in text.  
- For each: name the principle, explain how applying it would solve the issue, and state the user benefit.  

**Prompt:**  
"Make a text-based worksheet with 3 user complaints about an interface. For each, students identify a usability principle, explain its application, and describe the user benefit."

---

### 6) Heuristic Hunt + Impact
**Targets:** Explains how usability principles have been applied in the interface; …aids the user experience  
**Activity:**
- Read a text description of an online checkout with five features.  
- Choose three, name the principle, explain how it’s applied, and describe the impact on the user.  

**Prompt:**  
"Write a text-only activity where students read a feature list, choose three, link each to a usability principle, and explain the impact."

---

### 7) Swap the Heuristic
**Targets:** Explains how usability principles have been applied…; …aids the user experience  
**Activity:**
- Given three current features in text.  
- For each: explain how it applies a principle.  
- Then imagine it’s removed or replaced; explain how the user experience changes.  

**Prompt:**  
"Design a written worksheet where students explain current usability features, then predict user impact if each was removed or replaced."

---

### 8) Before / After Reasoning
**Targets:** Explains how usability principles have been applied…; …aids the user experience  
**Activity:**
- Read two text versions of a form (V1 clunky, V2 improved).  
- Identify two differences, name the principle in V2, explain how it’s applied, and describe the benefit.  

**Prompt:**  
"Create a text-based activity comparing two interface descriptions. Students identify differences, link to usability principles, and explain benefits."

---

## Excellence Level – Comparative Judgement & Improvements

### 9) Which Interface Wins — and Why?
**Targets:** Compares the usability of human-computer interfaces; Judges which interface used usability principles more effectively and explains why  
**Activity:**
- Read two text scenarios of apps completing the same task.  
- Compare three principles across both.  
- Decide the better interface and justify with principle-based reasons.  

**Prompt:**  
"Make a text-based worksheet comparing two interface descriptions. Students contrast usability principles and decide which is better with justification."

---

### 10) Redesign with Limits
**Targets:** Suggests multiple usability-based improvements…; Judges which interface used usability principles more effectively and explains why  
**Activity:**
- Read a flawed interface description in text.  
- Propose three improvements linked to principles.  
- Explain each improvement’s benefit, then rank and justify the order.  

**Prompt:**  
"Write a text-only activity where students propose three usability improvements for a described interface, explain benefits, and justify priority."

---

### 11) Trade-off Debate (Silent)
**Targets:** Compares the usability of human-computer interfaces; Judges which interface used usability principles more effectively and explains why; Suggests multiple usability-based improvements…  
**Activity:**
- Read two text versions of the same screen with different principle priorities.  
- Identify two trade-offs, choose the better version with reasons, and suggest two improvements to reduce the trade-off.  

**Prompt:**  
"Create a written worksheet where students read two interface descriptions with principle trade-offs, choose the better, and suggest fixes."
