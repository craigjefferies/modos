## Core Concepts & Principles

### Circular & Rotational Motion

**Angular Kinematics**  
- Angular displacement (Δθ), velocity (ω), acceleration (α)  
- Relationships to linear quantities:  
  - \( d = rθ \), \( v = rω \), \( a = rα \)  
- Kinematic equations for constant angular acceleration  

**Centripetal Force**  
- \( F_c = \frac{mv^2}{r} \), always towards center  
- Analysis of vertical circular motion using free-body diagrams  

**Rotational Dynamics**  
- Torque: \( τ = Iα \), \( τ = Fr \)  
- Rotational Inertia: \( I ∝ mr^2 \)  

**Angular Momentum**  
- \( L = Iω \) or \( L = mvr \)  
- Conservation in absence of external torque  

**Rotational Energy**  
- \( E_{k(rot)} = \frac{1}{2}Iω^2 \)  
- Total KE for rolling objects:  
  - \( E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \frac{1}{2}Iω^2 \)  
- Conservation of energy across linear and rotational forms  

### Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM)

**Conditions**  
- Restoring force/acceleration proportional to and opposite to displacement  

**Equations**  
- Displacement: \( y = A \sin(ωt) \)  
- Acceleration: \( a = -ω^2 y \)  
- Reference circles used for derivations  

**Period/Frequency**  
- \( ω = 2πf \), \( f = \frac{1}{T} \)  
- Pendulum: \( T = 2π \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}} \)  
- Mass-spring: \( T = 2π \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} \)  

**Energy**  
- Total mechanical energy conserved (kinetic + potential)  

**Damping**  
- Amplitude decreases due to energy loss  
- Period remains generally constant  
- Graphical representation: exponential decay  

### Linear Mechanics (Integrated)
- Centre of Mass: \( x_{COM} \)  
- Linear Momentum: \( p = mv \)  
- Impulse: \( Δp = FΔt \)  
- Conservation of Momentum (collisions)  
- Universal Gravitation: \( F_g = \frac{GMm}{r^2} \)  

## Essential Formulas
- Students are provided with the Level 3 Physics Resource Booklet (L3–PHYSR)  
- Includes all relevant formulas and constants  
- Emphasis on correct SI units and significant figures  

## Generalized Exam Question Types
- **Calculations**: e.g., angular velocity, SHM displacement  
- **Explanations**: Qualitative reasoning (e.g., mass distribution effects)  
- **Diagrams**: Free-body diagrams essential  
- **"Show that..." questions**: Require clear step-by-step working  
- **Integrated problems**: Combine linear + rotational motion, conservation laws  

## Common Student Errors & Misconceptions

### Circular Motion
- Confusing tension vs. normal force for "sensation of weight"  
- Incorrect or incomplete force diagrams  
- Misuse of force equations in vertical circles  

### Rotational Motion
- Using weight instead of tension in torque calculations  
- Missing rotational KE in energy conservation  
- Not linking mass distribution to \( I \) or angular momentum  

### SHM
- Poor damping explanations (e.g., not linking to energy loss)  
- Misleading displacement-time graphs for damped motion  
- Incomplete statement of SHM conditions  

### General
- Poor numerical working  
- Incorrect SI units or significant figures  
- Not following scaffolded exam instructions
