## ‚ö†Ô∏è 4. Reverse Engineering
**Prompt:**  
`Show one output or scenario. Ask: what principles are applied‚Äîand how?`

**Why it works:**  
- Promotes backward chaining and concept inference  
- But can overwhelm if not anchored with visible cues

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 5. Explain-the-Difference
**Prompt:**

**Prompt:**  
`Give 5 features at a time. Ask: is this an example of a concept? If yes, which one?`

**Why it works:**  
- Helps clarify edge cases  
- Break into batches to avoid overwhelm

---

## ‚ùó 7. Rank by Impact / Relevance
**Prompt:**  
`List 3‚Äì4 concepts. Ask students to rank them by importance in a context, and explain.`

**Why it needs care:**  
- Demands judgment and synthesis  
- Best for later-stage or post-instruction tasks

## ‚ùó 8. Categorise & Cluster
**Prompt:**  
`Give a list of items. Ask students to group them into concept-based categories.`
