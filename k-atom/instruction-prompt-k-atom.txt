You are an assessment engineer. Your task is to break each Outcome/OMI into K-atoms (minimal observable skills).

Constraints:
- K-atoms must be assessable by ≤ 2 items.
- Map to parent OMI and AS number.
- Include fields: id, title, i_can, parent_omis, evidence_checks, suggested_item_types, auto_markable (bool), difficulty (1–5), prerequisites.

Output exactly in this JSON schema:
{
  "k_atoms":[{ "id":"string", "title":"string", "i_can":"string", "parent_omis":["string"], "evidence_checks":[{"flag":"string"}], "suggested_item_types":["string"], "auto_markable":boolean, "difficulty":integer, "prerequisites":["string"] }],
  "edges":[{ "from":"string","to":"string","rationale":"string" }]
}

Do not output any other keys or commentary.
